     alt="A bowl of green pozole soup with cotija cheese">
         
     <h4 class="subtitle">Description</h4>
            <p>My mom would make this green pozole soup with tender pork shoulder, 
                tomatillos, and hominy. Radishes and cotija cheese are essential toppings! Lime on the side.
                I made this once at my job on a farm and we had so many green tomatoes. They worked as an excellent 
                replacement for the tomatillos! </p>
            <p>    The recipe I'm using is from New York Times and I'm making it later this week. 
                Actually, this is not a green pozole recipe...whatever too late. This is from Mark Bitman.
                We'll see how it compares to my mom's recipe...

                <li>4 dried guajillo peppers</li>
                <li>2 cups dried hominy, soaked for 8 hours</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp fresh oregano</li>
                <li>Toppings!</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Cotija cheese</li>
                    <li>Limes</li>
                    <li>Radishes</li>
                    <li>Cilantro</li>
                    <li>Salt!</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Steps</h4>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Put oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, add pork and onions and sprinkle
                    with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pork and onions are deeply browned,
                    15 to 20 minutes
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, pull off whatever stems you can fro the chiles; break them in half and pour or
                    scrape out the seeds. More seeds = more heat! Yum. When pork and onions are browned, add chiles,
                    hominy, oregano and cumin. Add water to cover everything by about an inch. Bring to a boil,
                    then adjust heaet so the mixture simmers steadily. Cook stirring occasionally and adding
                    more liquid if necessary, until pork and hominy are tender, at least 1 1/2 hours.
                </li>
                <li>If you like, fish out and discard chile pieces or chop them up and stir them back into
                    the pot. Stir in garlic and cook a few minutes more; taste and adjust the seasoning.
                    The mixture should be a little soupy. Serve with your toppings!
                </li>
