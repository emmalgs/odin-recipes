     <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>My mom would make this green pozole soup with tender pork shoulder, 
            tomatillos, and hominy. Radishes and cotija cheese are essential toppings! Lime on the side.
        I made this once at my job on a farm and we had so many green tomatoes. They worked as an excellent replacement for the tomatillos! </p>
