        <h4 class="subtitle">Description</h4>
            <p>My amazing aunt in Phoenix Arizona pulls out all the stops when we visit. I always look forward to her
                breakfast burritos. She makes these ahead of time and wraps them in tin foil. Then, my uncle pops them on 
                a hot grill in the morning. It is advantageous to use outdoor cooking methods in the Arizona heat...The 
                secret ingredient to these burritos is finding big, homemade flour tortillas. Thin, chewy, tender with some crispy spots...Yum.

            <ol class="list">
                <li>I like to have an assembly line going for these burritos. Prep everything first.</li>
                <li>Scramble the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Place in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Cook the chorizo until browned throughout. Place in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Peel, cube, and boil the potatoes. Place in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Now your assembly line is ready! Take a tortilla. In the center spoon egg, chorizo, and potatoes.
                    Top with a handful of shredded cheese. </li>
                <li>Roll your burrito up, keeping the sides tucked in! Watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/9t6F14EyQ88">video</a>
                    on how to roll a perfect burrito! Wrap in tin foil. You can freeze them for later or throw it in a hot oven for 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Absolutely and most importantly top with some good hot sauce and enjoy!</li>
