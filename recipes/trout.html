        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is a very simple recipe from my time at a sweet little french restaurant in Portland.
            The hardest part is actually the wrapping of the trout. You want a nice pouch that puffs up
            in a hot oven or near some hot coals if you're camping.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rainbow trout, head and innards removed.</li>
            <li>Neutral oil</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>Parchment paper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a spice grinder, put about 2 Tbsp of black pepper and a large handful or two of rosemary, tender parts only.</li>
            <li>Grind until it makes a fine, spicy smelling powder. Season with a few pinches of salt.</li>
            <li>Combine roesmary and pepper mix with about a cup of oil. I use a blend olive oil (a mix of vegetable and olive oil).
                Mix well until it forms a clumpless oily sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare your trout. Lay filetted trout flat. Cut out the spine and fins. You should have
                two pieces of trout now.
            </li>
            <li>Fold a piece of parchment paper measuring about 11x17 inches in half, hamburger style. Place a cleaned trout half along the folded line</li>
            <li>Spoon about 2 Tbsp of your oil mixture over the trout.</li>
            <li>Fold the parchment over the trout. Now form your pouch. Folding a little bit at a time, make your way 
                around the edge of the trout, about 7 folds in all.
            </li>
            <li>Set your oven to broil. Or start a campfire! If using the campfire method, you should've started
                that a while ago...Anyways, place your little pouch of trout a few racks below the broiler. You want it 
                hot, like 500F, but you don't want to start a parchment paper fire in your oven...
            </li>
            <li>It should take only about 3-5 minutes if your oven is hot enough to steam that sweet sweet trout!</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with a fresh salad and a glass of wine.</li>
        </ol>
